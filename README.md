- 👋 Hi, I’m Mohammad Taqi (@mtaqi04), a Software Engineer and tech lover from Ontario Tech University.
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack development, with a solid foundation in JavaScript, Java, C, and Python. I enjoy building complete solutions from the ground up, blending back-end logic with front-end usability.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my skills in React and Spring, exploring ways to create dynamic and efficient applications. I’m also learning CI/CD practices to streamline deployment for real-world projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that challenge and grow my skills in full-stack development, open-source projects, or anything involving creative problem-solving in tech.
